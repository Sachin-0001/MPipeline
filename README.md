# ML Pipeline with DVC & MLflow

This project demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow using DVC for data and model versioning, and MLflow for experiment tracking. The pipeline processes the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset with clear stages for preprocessing, training a Random Forest Classifier, and evaluation.

# **Key Features:**
- **DVC:** Tracks datasets, models, and pipeline stages for reproducibility and remote storage.
- **MLflow:** Logs experiments, hyperparameters, and metrics for easy comparison.
- **Pipeline Stages:**
  - *Preprocessing:* Cleans and prepares raw data.
  - *Training:* Trains and logs a Random Forest model.
  - *Evaluation:* Evaluates model accuracy and logs results.

# **Benefits:**  
Ensures reproducibility, supports experimentation, and enables collaboration.

# **Tech Stack:** 
Python, DVC, MLflow, Scikit-learn.

This setup helps teams and researchers efficiently manage, track, and reproduce machine learning
